# Gitcoin Grants Analysis

An analysis of Gitcoin Grant data for rounds 1-12. This repository is an entry for [this bounty](https://github.com/gitcoinco/skunkworks/issues/252#issue-1084213288) on Gitcoin.

This workbook contains the analysis from two main notebooks. You can view the source code for the data cleaning and all visuals in the following notebooks. All results and findings and recommendations are summarized in this document.

## The Data
First, some notes on the data that is available.


## Findings

![](./images/contrib_per_round_match.jpeg?raw=true)
![](./images/contributions_per_round.jpeg?raw=true)

* Contributions in round 12 were significantly larger than the past 3 rounds, setting a new all-time high since Round 8
  * This increase looks like it is due to increases in both contributions and matches
  * Matches were 3.2x larger than Round 11, contributions were 2x greater
* While contribution amounts are up significantly, the number of contributions in Round 12 is only slightly larger previous rounds
  * Number of contributions is consistently increasing between rounds. Even though rounds 9-11 had lower amounts than round 8, there were more individual contributions.
  * This could mean the contributions are larger during this round compared to previous rounds, or that matching amounts are significantly higher.

* The proportion of contributions coming from matches is increasing, reaching a new high in Round 12 since Round 7.
* Round 8 (the previous record for contributions) had the lowest proportion of funds coming from a match

![](./images/grants_per_category.jpeg?raw=true)

* The largest category increases in Round 12 came from "Community" and "dapp tech"
  * Each of these more than doubled between Rounds 11 and 12
* The category with the most steady growth is "NFTs" which makes sense given current trends in the wider market
* Round 12 has a general "Grants Round 12" category which could be throwing off these results
